Info: Cellview Rev Num:99,  Tech Rev Num:59

WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'adc' is attached to the technology library 'sky130_fd_pr_main'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /mnt/cae_storage_sw/eda/cadence/pdks/sky130/sky130_release_004a/libs/sky130_fd_pr_main/sky130_fd_pr_main.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-69): All the libraries specified in 'cds.lib' will be considered as reference libraries. This is because '-refLibList' option is specified as "XST_CDS_LIB".
WARNING (XSTRM-333): The '-enableColoring' option will be ignored during XStream In. This is because there is no color entry in the layer map and the object map file.
INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If a viaMap file, corresponding technology file or technology library exist, then use the '-viaMap' option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'INVX2' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated. This is because either the '-refLibList' option is used and the cellview is available in the reference library 'sky130_scl_9T' or the STRUCTURE is not mapped to the target library using the cell map file/piCellMap SKILL function. Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'sky130_scl_9T/INVX2/layout'.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'BUFX16' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated. This is because either the '-refLibList' option is used and the cellview is available in the reference library 'sky130_scl_9T' or the STRUCTURE is not mapped to the target library using the cell map file/piCellMap SKILL function. Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'sky130_scl_9T/BUFX16/layout'.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'OAI21X1' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated. This is because either the '-refLibList' option is used and the cellview is available in the reference library 'sky130_scl_9T' or the STRUCTURE is not mapped to the target library using the cell map file/piCellMap SKILL function. Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'sky130_scl_9T/OAI21X1/layout'.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'DFFRX4' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated. This is because either the '-refLibList' option is used and the cellview is available in the reference library 'sky130_scl_9T' or the STRUCTURE is not mapped to the target library using the cell map file/piCellMap SKILL function. Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'sky130_scl_9T/DFFRX4/layout'.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'NAND4X2' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated. This is because either the '-refLibList' option is used and the cellview is available in the reference library 'sky130_scl_9T' or the STRUCTURE is not mapped to the target library using the cell map file/piCellMap SKILL function. Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'sky130_scl_9T/NAND4X2/layout'.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'OR2X1' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated.

Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'sky130_scl_9T/OR2X1/layout'.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'CLKINVX2' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated. This is because either the '-refLibList' option is used and the cellview is available in the reference library 'sky130_scl_9T' or the STRUCTURE is not mapped to the target library using the cell map file/piCellMap SKILL function. Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'sky130_scl_9T/CLKINVX2/layout'.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'DFFRX1' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated.
